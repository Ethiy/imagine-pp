\section Introduction

Imagine++ is a set of libraries developed at the %Imagine group
(http://imagine.enpc.fr). Initially designed for students and beginners, and though it is still easy enough for them, Imagine++ is now used daily by %Imagine researchers. It consists in different modules. Four of them are publicly available:
- The \ref Common, providing basic types and utilities.
- The \ref LinAlg, providing linear algebra types and algorithms
- The \ref Graphics, providing convenient 2D and 3D displays 
- The \ref Images, providing image containers and algorithms

Some useful links:
- The Imagine++ home page is http://imagine.enpc.fr/~monasse/Imagine++
- A quick start <a href="quickStartImagine++.pdf">guide</a>
- This C++ course for beginners (in French...) makes extensive use of Imagine++, especially of the Graphics module: http://imagine.enpc.fr/~monasse/Info/
