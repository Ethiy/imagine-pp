/*! \page install_linux Linux installation

  The easiest is to use an installer, if available for your distribution. However, if you do not have root privileges, you can use a binary package. If you want to build directly from source, you will end up with a binary package adapted for your system. Do not forget to set the <tt>Imagine_DIR</tt> environment variable.

  \section il1 Installers

  If you are using Debian or derivative distribution (Ubuntu...), you can use the appropriate package, which will automatically fetch the dependencies.

  - 64 bits: http://imagine.enpc.fr/~monasse/Imagine++/downloads/Imagine++-@IMAGINEPP_VERSION@-Linux-x86_64.deb
  - 32 bits: http://imagine.enpc.fr/~monasse/Imagine++/downloads/Imagine++-@IMAGINEPP_VERSION@-Linux-i686.deb

To install, enter the following command in a terminal:
\code
xdg-open Imagine++-@IMAGINEPP_VERSION@-Linux-x86_64.deb
\endcode
If the interface complains about "bad package quality" or proposes to "repair", agree and continue installation.

  The last point is to set your <tt>Imagine_DIR</tt> environment variable. To do it permanently: assuming that you installed into <tt>/usr/share/Imagine++</tt>, as the Debian package does:
  - enter the following command in a terminal
\code
echo "Imagine_DIR DEFAULT=/usr/share/Imagine++" >> $HOME/.pam_environment
\endcode
  - log out and log in again
  - to check everything works:
\code
mkdir Test && cd Test
cmake $Imagine_DIR/test
make
\endcode

Go to \ref usage and check the tests.

  \section il2 Alternative: Binary package

  If you use another distribution, or if you do not have root privileges, you can download and extract the binary archive, after having installed the dependencies with your package manager: libqt5opengl5-dev, cmake-qt-gui, g++, gdb.

  - 64 bits: http://imagine.enpc.fr/~monasse/Imagine++/downloads/Imagine++-@IMAGINEPP_VERSION@-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz
  - 32 bits: http://imagine.enpc.fr/~monasse/Imagine++/downloads/Imagine++-@IMAGINEPP_VERSION@-Linux-i686.tar.gz

  \section il3 Alternative: Building from source 

  If for any reason one of the methods above is not appropriate for you, follow carefully these steps to create a binary package adapted to your system.

  \subsection il31 1. Sources

  Get the sources here http://imagine.enpc.fr/~monasse/Imagine++/downloads/Imagine++-@IMAGINEPP_VERSION@-Source.tar.gz and decompress them.

  \subsection il32 2. Tools

  Get and install the following with your package manager.
  - Check that Qt is installed. You need not only the Qt runtime libraries, but also the header files. This is in a package called 'libqt5opengl5-dev'.
  - CMake.
  - g++.
  - optionally, doxygen.

  The commands below work with Debian and derivatives (Ubuntu and variants):
  \code
  sudo apt-get install libqt5opengl5-dev
  sudo apt-get install cmake
  sudo apt-get install g++
  sudo apt-get install doxygen
  \endcode

  \subsection il33 3. Build

  The following commands build the packages.
  \code
  mkdir BuildImagine
  cd BuildImagine
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:string=Release /path/to/Imagine++-directory
  make
  make package
  \endcode

  You should see the binary archive and maybe the Debian package. You should then install one of them, following the instructions above (\ref il1 or \ref il2).

  Before installing, you may wish to check the tests, for example:
  \code
  ./Imagine/Graphics/test/ImagineGraphicsTest
  \endcode

  If the process fails somewhere, please check \ref trouble. 

  \subsection il34 4. Documentation

  If you want to build the documentation, run
  \code
  make doc
  \endcode
  before 'make package'
