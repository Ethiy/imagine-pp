# Imagine++

## Disclaimer
This is a fork of the [Imagine++ project](http://imagine.enpc.fr/~monasse/Imagine++) developped by [Imagine research group](http://imagine.enpc.fr).
If you are looking for a lightweight Image Processing and Computer Vision C++ library, I recommend to check out this library.

## Introduction
This Library contains four publicly available modules:
* The Common Library: providing basic types and utilities.
* The LinAlg Library: providing linear algebra types and algorithms
* The Graphics Library: providing convenient 2D and 3D displays
* The Images Library: providing image containers and algorithms

For more details you should check The official [website](http://imagine.enpc.fr/~monasse/Imagine++/index.html). I find it very well documented. You should also note that it builds on various Platforms(Linux, OsX and Windows).
